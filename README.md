# Rowing-GPX-Analysis
## Introduction
_GPX Analysis for rowing written in Python with a Flask/ React Web Interface_
#### Why?
I couldn't find the code for the old GPX analysis tool I wrote, so I'm taking the
opportunity to build a better/ more robust one.

## Prerequisites
#### Python Requirements
- Python 3.10 (or later)
- Numpy ```pip install numpy```
- Matplotlib ```pip install matplotlib```
- Pillow (may already be installed with mpl) ```pip install pillow```
- Flask ```pip install flask```
- mpld3 ```pip install mpld3```
#### Javascript Requirements
- D3 is installed from the internet at runtime
- mpl3 is installed from the internet at runtime

_These two requirements mean that the application requires an internet connection to run._
