# Rowing-GPX-Analysis
## Introduction
_GPX Analysis for rowing written in Python with a tkinter matplotlib interface_
#### Why?
I couldn't find the code for the old GPX analysis tool I wrote, so I'm taking the
opportunity to build a better/ more robust one.

## Prerequisites
#### Python Requirements
- Python 3.10 (or later)
- Numpy ```pip install numpy```
- Matplotlib ```pip install matplotlib```
- Pillow (may already be installed with mpl) ```pip install pillow```

_Given it downloads map images from online it requires an internet connection to run._
